# NavPath
This is the relevant code used in my videos for Navigation Mesh Generation and Pathing

This code is meant to serve as a guide for information/implmentation purposes. There is no data set packaged with this code. 

Primary NavMesh and Pathing code can be found in ManifestSimulation/IntelligenceEngine

All secondary code can be found throughout the various ManifestX systems.
